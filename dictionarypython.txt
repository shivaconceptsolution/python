Tuple in Python:-
.................................................................
tuple is immutable composite variable of python which is used to create constant list.

it is also used to store elements using proper sequence but we can not append,edit elements of tuples dynamically.


Declaration of tuple:-

varname = (value1,value2,value3,value4)

subject = ("phy","chem","maths","eng","hin")

it will be accessed similar to LIST.

for i in range(0,len(subject)):
  print(subject[i])

for s in subject:
  print(s)


limitation of tuples :  we can modify tuple objects.
Dictionary concept in python:-
........................................................................
dictionaty provide collection of key=>value pair .key is used to provide identity and value is used to provide data.

student = {"rno":1001,"sname":"manish kumar","branch":"cs","fees":12000}

print(student["rno"])

dictionary use foreach loop to display elements .

for key in student:
   print("key is "+key +" value is "+student[key])


Advantage:-
it provide fast searching operation to search elements set.

it can be easily mapped with table data and JSON (Java script Object Notation)
