File Handling operation in Python:-
.........................................................................
File is a collection of records .it is used to store program output parmanently in computer hardisk.

File type is based on file extension .

for example we can save record in text file using .txt,.doc,.xlsx,.xls


we can store data into binary file also .

for example if we store data in image file,medial file ,object file than we will use binary file system.
...........................................................................

open("filename","mode of file")

r -----> read

w ------> write

r+ ------> read|write

w+ -------> write|read

rb --------> read binary file

rb+ -------> read and write for binary file

wb+ -------> write and read operation

a --------> it is used to append file

a+ ------> append ,read

ab ------> it is used to append binary file

ab+ -------> append and read binary file
How we create file ,Write Data on File and Read Data From FIle.

predefine function in python to perform Read,Write and Create file

Create File   open("filename","mode")

write             write()

Read              read()

Absoloute path:-  it is called direct path of operating system.

c:/abc/abc1/hello.txt


Relative path:-  we can provide project path

projectfoldername/filename


How we read data from file in Python:-

ref  = open(filename,"r")
ref  = open(filename,"rb")  //binary

 ref  = open(filename,"r+") //read write
 ref  = open(filename,"rb+") //read write
Read and write data in a single program

ref= open("filename","w+")

seek() and tell() in python:-

seek() is used to set position of file pointer to particular index.

seek(5)

file pointer index will be set to 5 index char

tell():-  it will return current position of file pointer
