Operator in python:-
.....................................

it is used to perform operation using operand,operand can be variable or constant.

python all operator has define as predefine function.


type of operator:-

1 increment|decrement

   a=a+1
   a=a-1



2 Arithmatic:-

  +,-,*,/,//,%

  +  addition,concatenation

  -  substraction

  *  multiplication

  / divide

 //  divide with highest numeric value 1.2 

  ** power

 %   rem



3 conditional operator

   <,
   >,
   <=,
   >=
   !=


4  comparision operator

   ==
   
5  assignment

   single value assignment   a=2
   multi  value assignment   a,b,c = 1,2,3



6 logical operator

   and --> if all condition true then ,and operator return true value
   or ---> if only one condition will be true then ,or operator will return true value.

  NOT ---> it is just opposite of true statement and convert the data into false statement.



7  identity operator

    is :-         it is used to compare object ,if it is identical then return true otherwise false

    is not :-      it will return true if object is not identical otherwise return false 

.........................................................

8 Membership operator

   in :-  it is used to check existance of an elements that element is preasent or not.



  not in:- it will return false value if element exist otherwise return true


note: these operator will be used in LIST,Tuple and Dictionary elements.

..........................................................

variable and constant in python:-




if identifier value can be change in program then it is called variable.


python variable is very flexible in size and data both.


no need to declare data type in python ,it is managed by assigned value.


hence we can reuse single variable for multiple type of values


identifier=value

Constant:- 
it is special identifier whose value will be FIXED in complete program.


we will use uppercase for constant and lower case for variable.


x=10

X=10

Datatype in python:-
..........................................................
python manage abstract data type which is used to provide memory allocation to variables and constant.


python has two different type of data type


value type:-  it use stack memory to reserve data

int type data,float type data,boolean data



reference type:- it use heap memory to reserve data.

string,list,tuple,dictionary,object
